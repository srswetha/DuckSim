# 🦆 DuckSim - Design Patterns in Kotlin

## 📌 Overview
**DuckSim** is a Kotlin-based GUI application that allows users to simulate a **Duck Simulator** using **Object-Oriented Programming** and **Design Patterns** such as **Strategy, Decorator, Factory, Adapter, Observer, and Composite**.

This project enhances an existing DuckSim application by refactoring and extending its functionalities using design patterns, ensuring **modular**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** software design.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **GUI-Based Duck Simulation** – Create, modify, and interact with ducks visually.  
✅ **Strategy Pattern** – Encapsulates **flying** and **quacking** behavior dynamically.  
✅ **Decorator Pattern** – Adds **bling** (stars, moons, crosses) to ducks dynamically.  
✅ **Factory Pattern** – Centralized duck creation using a **singleton factory**.  
✅ **Adapter Pattern** – Converts a **Goose** into a compatible **DuckSim** object.  
✅ **Observer Pattern** – Ducks react to new duck additions in the **DuckSim Welcoming Committee (DSWC)**.  
✅ **Composite Pattern** – Allows **Flock creation**, grouping ducks together.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin  
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing  
- **Design Patterns**: Strategy, Decorator, Factory, Adapter, Observer, Composite  
- **Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, Git, GitHub  

## 🎮 Gameplay Features
- **Left-Click a Duck**– Highlights the selected duck.
- **Right-Click a Duck** – Shows a context menu to change behavior.
- **Capture/Release Ducks** – Disables or enables flying and quacking.
- **Customize Bling** – Add visual accessories to ducks.
- **Create a Flock** – Group ducks together for composite behavior.

 ## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- 🔹 Implement realistic duck physics
- 🔹 Add sound effects for quacking & flying
- 🔹 Support networked multiplayer duck simulation
